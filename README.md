## People-Analysis

### What is People Analysis
People analytics collects and applies organizational, people, and talent data to improve critical business outcomes. It enables HR departments to gain data-driven insights to make decisions on different people processes and turn them into actions to drive the performance of an organization.

### What is People data consisting of ?

It’s all the information an organization collects about its employees: data points like age, tenure, gender, job role, salary, quits, performance ratings, and more job-specific data like sales quotas or closed support tickets, for instance. 
People analytics software pulls this information via API from your digital HR tools (HRIS, HCM, ATS, payroll, etc.), applicant tracking, onboarding, compensation, talent management, and payroll systems and transforms it using data science. 

### Difference between people analytics and HR analytics
The terms people analytics and HR analytics are frequently used interchangeably. However, there is a difference. HR analytics implies the data is exclusive to Human Resources, while people analytics goes beyond HR and includes finance, customer, marketing, and other data sources.

### The four types of people analytics
There are four types of people analytics, each of which offers different insights. Each can be helpful but offers a more comprehensive picture when combined. When deciding which method to implement, please look at your needs and the data you have access to.
1. Descriptive analytics
Descriptive analysis (also known as decision analytics) is a basic type of people analytics that analyses the patterns in historical data sets to gain insight into what happened. However, descriptive analysis does not use this data to make future predictions.
2. Diagnostic analytics
Diagnostic analytics takes descriptive analytics a step further and explains the insights revealed in the data's trends, correlations, and anomalies. 
3. Predictive analytics
Predictive analytics categorizes past and present data to determine insights and then uses an estimating model to predict what might happen in the future.
4. Prescriptive analytics
Prescriptive analytics is the final step that channels predictive analytics into decision options and actions to achieve success.

### How do you use people analytics to make decisions?
So, what exactly can you do with people analytics? Every day, decisions are being made across your organization that impact your people. With people analytics, leaders have access to the insights they need to back up their instincts with facts and data-driven strategies that help their organization grow.
People analytics shows your data in one view so you can answer and act on important questions and answer questions you have yet to think of to avoid unintentional biases contributing to bad business decisions. Here are some examples of questions people analytics can help answer:
•	Does the organization need to hire more people?
•	Who needs a promotion?
•	Who might be at risk of quitting? 

## Conclusion 
In conclusion, people analytics offers organizations a powerful tool to gain deep insights into their workforce and drive strategic decisions. By leveraging data and analytics, organizations can improve various HR processes, enhance employee satisfaction and engagement, and achieve better business outcomes. 

However, to fully realize the benefits of people analytics, organizations must invest in data collection and analysis capabilities and ensure they have the right talent and culture to support data-driven decision-making. With the right approach, people analytics can be a key driver of organizational success in today's competitive business environment.
